## 0.26.0 — Sprint 26 (MCP server enhancements)

### Added
- **Batch card lookup (`get_cards`)** — New MCP tool that resolves several cards in one call. Names are matched against the local DB first (no rate limit), and any misses are fetched from Scryfall in a single `POST /cards/collection` request (chunked at 75/req via the new `ScryfallClient.get_cards_collection`). Returns details + prices per card and a `not_found` list.
- **Batch collection lookup (`find_cards_in_collection`)** — Batched version of `find_card_in_collection`: owned/foil counts, deck usage and price for many cards in a single SQL pass.
- **`bulk_add_to_wishlist`** — Add many cards to the wishlist at once (e.g. paste a decklist) with shared priority/tags/deck; reports added vs skipped.
- **Structured `analyze_deck`** — MCP tool returning mana curve, colour-pip distribution, card-type breakdown and average mana value (previously only a prompt template).
- **`get_acquisition_history`** — Exposes the Inbox booking archive (see 0.24.0) over MCP.

### Fixed
- **MCP `get_duplicates` colour filter** — Now uses the same format-robust colour matching as the REST API (see 0.24.0), so single-colour filters behave identically in both.

## 0.25.0 — Sprint 25 (cross-cutting UI)

### Added
- **"Lands" filter option** — A 🟤 Lands choice was added to the colour filters on the Wishlist and Inbox tabs (Duplicates and Cardmarket already had it), filtering to land-type cards. Backed by the shared, format-robust colour-filter helper.
- **Open on Cardmarket** — Every card row in the Duplicates, Inbox and Collection tabs now has an icon button that opens the card's Cardmarket page in a new tab (shared `CardmarketButton`).
- **Back to Top** — A floating button appears after scrolling and smoothly returns to the top of the page (`components/BackToTop.tsx`, attached to the main scroll container).

### Changed
- **Deck "Combos in this Deck"** — The section is now collapsible and **collapsed by default** (state persisted). Cards listed in a combo's detail dialog are now clickable links that open the card's Scryfall page in a new tab.

## 0.24.0 — Sprint 24 (intake & duplicates reliability)

### Fixed
- **Single-colour pip filters returned nothing** — Filtering by Red/Blue/etc. in the Inbox and Duplicates (and Collection/Wishlist) tabs missed cards whose `color_identity` was stored in a non-JSON form, because the SQL required literal JSON quotes (`LIKE '%"R"%'`). Colour matching is now format-robust (matches the bare colour letter and counts distinct WUBRG letters for mono/multi/colourless), applied consistently across all routers and the MCP `get_duplicates` tool. A defensive `parse_color_identity` helper also prevents the API from crashing on non-JSON values.
- **Intake duplicate check missed owned copies** — The triage advisor matched other printings case-sensitively (inconsistent with the rest of the app) and, when a new copy merged into an existing collection row, excluded that whole row — hiding a genuine pre-existing duplicate. Matching is now case-insensitive and subtracts only the freshly-arrived quantity from its own row.

### Added
- **Inbox booking history / archive** — Confirming a triage decision now records a snapshot of the decision, the suggestion shown and the card's state at that moment (new `decision_snapshot` column, migration 16). A new **History** view in the Inbox (`GET /api/acquisitions/history`) shows how each item was booked and how it was presented at confirmation.
- **Duplicates urgency tools** — A "Most copies" sort plus quick-filter pills ("≥ 3 / ≥ 5 surplus", "≥ €5 / ≥ €20 value", "Not yet listed") to surface the most pressing duplicates (`min_extras` / `min_value_eur` / `unlisted_only` query params).

## 0.23.0 — Sprint 23 (wishlist enhancements)

### Added
- **Ordered-cards filter** — The Wishlist (wanted tab) now has an "Ordered / Not ordered / All" filter over the existing `is_ordered` flag.
- **Interactive price chart on hover** — Hovering a wishlist card name shows an interactive sparkline of the last 2 weeks of Cardmarket trend prices; the popup is hoverable and a crosshair tracks the cursor to read the price/date at each point. The reusable `PriceTrendHover` now also powers the Cardmarket page's price hover, and `Sparkline` gained an `interactive` mode.

### Fixed
- **Wishlist image didn't follow the chosen edition** — Editing a wishlist item's set/version only updated the displayed image/price when that printing already existed locally; the chosen printing is now imported from Scryfall when missing, so the thumbnail and price always match the selected edition.

## 0.22.0

### Added
- **Deck Performance Tracker** — Log how each game went and see aggregate stats per deck. Each game records result (win/loss/draw), date, on-the-play, pod size, mulligans, missed land drops, turns, opponents/commanders, and free-text "what worked / what didn't / notes". A new section on the deck page shows win rate, W/L/D, recent form, on-play win rate, and averages, plus a list of recent games. Backed by a new `deck_games` table (migration 15) and `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /api/decks/{id}/games` + `GET /api/decks/{id}/performance`.

### Fixed
- **Deck view hover/category overlap** — The card hover-preview is now scoped to the card name only, so it no longer overlaps the adjacent "+N" extra-category tooltip when both were triggered.

## 0.21.0

### Fixed
- **Cardmarket Active Listings showed nothing** — The v0.17.3 listings query used a correlated subquery inside a `LEFT JOIN ... ON` that raised `sqlite3.OperationalError: no such column: l.set_code`, so `/api/cardmarket/listings` 500'd and the table rendered "No listings". The card match is now resolved in Python: listings are fetched plainly and each is paired with exactly one best-match card (preferring the matching set, then most recent), which also keeps the v0.17.3 fix against row multiplication.
- **Misleading empty state** — The "Sync from profile" hint (no such feature exists) is now "Import a CSV or list duplicates from the Duplicates tab."

## 0.20.0

### Added
- **Collection Tag filter** — A real filter dropdown for collection (Archidekt) tags, backed by a new `GET /api/collection/tags` endpoint that returns the distinct individual tags. (The tag badge was already shown; previously only a *sort* existed.)
- **Wishlist set/version editing anytime** — The Edit dialog now has a Set/Version picker and a Foil toggle, editable for any status (wanted/ordered/acquired). `WishlistItemUpdate` (PATCH) accepts `set_code` + `is_foil`, and choosing a set now repoints the item to that printing so the displayed set name, image and price follow the choice (also applied on Order/Acquire).

### Changed
- **Wishlist order badge** — The "Ordered" badge now uses a cleaner soft (tint) rounded style.

## 0.19.0

### Added
- **Inbox name search** — Search pending acquisitions by card name.
- **Inbox sort** — Sort the inbox by Newest, Color, Set, or Name.
- **Inbox color filter** — Dropdown to show only one colour bucket (W/U/B/R/G/Multicolor/Colorless) across all pages, complementing the existing colour headers.
- **"Fix colors" backfill** — `POST /api/acquisitions/backfill-colors` re-fetches colour data from Scryfall for pending cards whose `color_identity` is empty (Archidekt sometimes returns a thin card), so the colour groups/filter stop classifying everything as Colorless. Exposed as a button in the Inbox.

### Fixed
- **Basic lands in Inbox** — Inbox now excludes basic lands by name (shared with Duplicates), covering snow-covered basics and cards with an empty `type_line`.

## 0.18.0

### Fixed
- **Basic lands shown in Duplicates** — Filtering relied on `type_line NOT LIKE '%Basic Land%'`, which let through Snow-Covered basics (`Basic Snow Land — …`) and any card with an empty `type_line` (e.g. Cardmarket-imported cards). Replaced with a deterministic **name-based** exclusion (`Plains/Island/Swamp/Mountain/Forest/Wastes` + Snow-Covered variants), shared via `services/queries.basic_land_exclusion_sql()` and reused by the MCP `get_duplicates` tool.
- **Duplicates color filter (monocolor)** — Selecting a single color now matches every card whose colour identity **includes** that colour (mono **and** multicolor), and a new **Monocolor** option lists all single-colour cards.

### Changed
- **Test harness** — Tests now initialise an isolated, file-backed SQLite database per test (lifespan isn't run under `ASGITransport`), fixing the previously-failing acquisitions smoke tests and enabling seeded API tests.

## 0.17.3

### Fixed
- **Cardmarket listings duplicated rows** — The LEFT JOIN to the `cards` table matched ALL printings of a card name, multiplying listing rows. Replaced with a scalar subquery that picks exactly one card per listing (preferring matching set_code, then most recent).
- **Cardmarket SET column empty** — Frontend now displays `set_name` (expansion) from the listing instead of the always-empty `set_code`.

## 0.17.2

### Fixed
- **Deck sync card loss (foil/non-foil)** — Changed `INSERT OR REPLACE` to `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE SET quantity += excluded.quantity` so duplicate keys (same card_id + modifier) sum quantities instead of silently discarding the first entry. Fixes 5-card loss when same basic land exists as both Normal and Foil.
- **DeckView hero text in light mode** — Hero title and meta text now always use light colors (`#EDEDF5`) since the overlay is always dark, regardless of theme mode.

## 0.17.1

### Fixed
- **Cardmarket CSV import** — Added diagnostic logging and empty-file guard; header detection now strips whitespace for resilience against format changes; frontend shows `error_details` on failed imports.
- **Deck card count** — Card count now uses `SUM(quantity)` instead of `COUNT(rows)`, correctly reflecting total cards including multiples.

## 0.17.0

### Added
- **Cross-set selling** — Sell dialog shows per-printing breakdown (set + foil) with individual sell actions and quantity caps.
- **Bulk-Sell** — Multi-select printings of the same card and create Cardmarket listings in one step.
- **Column sort (Duplicates)** — Clickable table headers for name, extras, price, and set.
- **include_listed toggle (Duplicates)** — Checkbox to show/hide rows where all extras are already listed.
- **Multi-category deduplication (Deck View)** — Cards appear under first category only; secondary categories shown via hover badge.
- **AI Assessment collapsible** — AIAssessmentBox is now collapsible with localStorage persistence.
- **Color filter (Wishlist)** — W/U/B/R/G/M/C filter bar replaces accordion grouping.
- **Group-by-Card-Name toggle (Wishlist)** — Expandable rows grouping same card across sets/conditions.
- **Set/Version selection (Wishlist)** — Set picker when marking items as Ordered or Acquired.

### Fixed
- **Monocolor filter** — Duplicates color filter now excludes multicolor cards (cards with commas in color_identity).
- **Extras calculation** — Subtracts Cardmarket-listed quantity aggregated by card_name (not per-printing).
- **Combo Detection** — Fixed Spellbook API payload format (list of dicts) and response parsing (`results.included`).
- **Wishlist all Colorless** — Added `c.color_identity` to wishlist SELECT query.
- **Order tag styling** — Cleaned up "Bestell Tag" visual appearance.
- **Collection tag display** — Tag badge rendered on collection entries.
- **Branding** — Header renamed from "STELLAR·VAULT" to "MTG·Collection Manager".
- **Cardmarket listing count** — Section header shows "LISTINGS" instead of misleading "ROWS".
- **Inbox basic lands** — Pending acquisitions queries exclude Basic Lands via `type_line NOT LIKE '%Basic Land%'`.

## 0.16.0

### Changed
- **Duplicates page: printing-level aggregation** — one row per (card + set + foil) instead of card-name grouping.
- **Listing-aware extras** — `extras_after_listings` subtracts already-listed Cardmarket quantities; default hides fully-listed rows.
- **Basic Land filter** — Basic Lands excluded from duplicates.
- **Color filter (CSV)** — supports W,U,B,R,G,M,C,L with AND logic for multi-color.
- **Scoped set filter** — new `GET /api/collection/duplicates/sets` returns only sets with actual duplicates.
- **Foil indicator** — ◆ badge on foil printings in table and sell dialog.
- **Sell dialog respects foil & listing cap** — quantity capped to `extras_after_listings`, `is_foil` passed to listing.
- **MCP `get_duplicates` updated** — mirrors printing-level logic with color param.

### Fixed
- **Group dropdown crash** — removed crashing Group-by dropdown (caused black screen).
- **CSS spacing** — added padding between Value column and Sell button.

### Performance
- **Composite index** on `cardmarket_listings(card_name, set_code, is_foil)` for JOIN performance.

## 0.15.0

### Performance
- **SQLite WAL + PRAGMA tuning**: `journal_mode=WAL`, `synchronous=NORMAL`, `cache_size=-20000` (20 MB page cache), `temp_store=MEMORY` applied to every connection.
- **Connection pool** raised from 2 → 6 concurrent DB connections.
- **Migration 14**: 5 new indices (`idx_cards_name_nocase`, `idx_cards_set_code`, `idx_deck_cards_card_id`, `idx_collection_card_id`, `idx_cardmarket_listings_card_name`) + `ANALYZE`.
- **GZip middleware** (`minimum_size=1000`) compresses API payloads by ~60–80%.
- **Cache-Control headers** on hot read endpoints: `/collection/sets` (60 s), `/decks/`, `/stats/`, `/cardmarket/stats` (30 s each).
- **React Query migration**: All 8 pages (Collection, DeckView, Decks, Cardmarket, Duplicates, Settings, Dashboard, Inbox) fully migrated to `useQuery`/`useMutation`. Zero legacy `useEffect` data-fetchers remaining. QueryClient defaults: `staleTime=30s`, `gcTime=5min`, `retry=1`, `refetchOnWindowFocus=false`, `keepPreviousData`.
- **Deck prefetch on hover**: `Decks.tsx` prefetches deck detail on mouse-enter via `queryClient.prefetchQuery`.

### Fixed
- **Cardmarket stats**: `/api/cardmarket/stats` now correctly distinguishes `unique_cards` (`COUNT(DISTINCT card_name)`) from `total_rows` (raw listing count). Header shows "X CARDS · Y LISTINGS · Z COPIES". `unique_listings` retained as deprecated backward-compat field.
- **Cardmarket search regression**: Each keystroke no longer fires an API request — search is committed on Enter only (`searchInput` / `committedSearch` split).

## 0.14.1

### Fixed
- **Inbox White-Screen Crash** (`TypeError: undefined is not an object`): `getColorBucket` now handles null/undefined cards, null/empty/JSON-array-string/concatenated-letter (`WU`) color identities without throwing. Root cause was `Map.get(undefined).push()` when a card had a malformed or missing `color_identity`.
- **`groupByColorBucket`** pre-initialises all 8 `BucketKey` slots so `.get()` can never return `undefined`.
- **`Duplicates.tsx`** migrated to `getColorBucketLegacy` — no type regression.

### Added
- **`ErrorBoundary` component** (`frontend/src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx`): Class component with `getDerivedStateFromError`, `componentDidCatch`, and a `retry()` callback; wraps the Inbox list as defense-in-depth so a single render error cannot white-screen the whole page.
- **`BucketKey` type + `BUCKET_KEYS` + `groupByColorBucket`** exported from `utils/colors.ts`.
- **Vitest** added to frontend devDependencies (`npm test`) with 16 regression tests covering all `color_identity` edge cases — all green.

## 0.14.0

### Fixed
- **Schema-Drift Fix** (`triage_advisor.py`): Column names corrected — `cph.trend_eur` → `cph.trend`, `cph.snapshot_at` → `cph.date`. Resolves `/api/acquisitions/pending` returning HTTP 500 and Inbox showing empty despite 190+ pending cards.

### Added
- **Graceful Triage Fallback**: `get_suggestion()` wrapped in `try/except` — `sqlite3.OperationalError` and unexpected exceptions are caught, logged via `logger.error/exception`, and a safe `DEFAULT_SUGGESTION` (action: `keep`) is returned. Schema drift in future sprints can no longer crash the entire `/pending` route.
- **Inbox ErrorBanner**: Inbox page now distinguishes three states: (1) truly empty (celebration 🎉), (2) `loadError` or items/stats mismatch → `ErrorBanner` with pending count and Retry button, (3) normal items list. Prevents misleading "Inbox zero" when the backend fails.
- **ErrorBanner Component** (`frontend/src/components/ErrorBanner.tsx`): Reusable Fluent UI `MessageBar`-based error display with title, message, and optional action slot.
- **Acquisition Smoke Tests** (`backend/tests/test_acquisitions_smoke.py`): Two `pytest-asyncio` tests asserting `/api/acquisitions/pending` and `/api/acquisitions/stats` return HTTP 200 with correct response shapes against an in-memory SQLite DB.
- **`requirements-dev.txt`**: New file — `pytest>=8`, `pytest-asyncio>=0.23`, `httpx>=0.27` for backend test runs.
- **i18n**: 4 new keys per language — `inbox.empty_celebration`, `inbox.error.title`, `inbox.error.api_failed`, `common.retry` (EN + DE).

## 0.13.0

### Added
- **Sprint 13 — Triage Polish, Categorization & Hover-Fix**
- **CardHoverPreview Refactor**: Portal-based hover preview (`createPortal` → `document.body`), z-index 2147483000 — survives all Fluent UI dialogs; auto-hides on scroll/resize; 200 ms show delay; bounds-checked with oracle-text height
- **Sibling-Aware Triage**: Advisor detects earlier pending events for the same card (`ae.id < current`) and factors them into sell/keep logic — prevents double-keep on batch imports
- **Sell Price Pre-Fill**: Triage dialog pre-fills price from Cardmarket trend price (falls back to Scryfall EUR); hint text shown below field; uses `triage.sell_price_hint` i18n key
- **Multi-Copy Sell Qty**: `sold_new` triage exposes quantity selector (1…qty_delta) when more than one copy arrived; `sell_qty` validated server-side (422 if > qty_delta)
- **Inbox Filter Bar**: Three filter pills — All / Suggested: Sell / Suggested: Keep — URL-persistent via `useSearchParams`
- **Inbox Color-Grouping**: Events grouped by MTG color bucket (W/U/B/R/G/M/C/L), collapsible sections, collapse state persisted in localStorage
- **Duplicates Page Filter+Group+Sort**: Search, color dropdown, set dropdown, group-by (None/Color/Set), sort (value/extras/name/set/color) — all URL-persistent
- **Cardmarket Listings Filter**: Color, set, source (Draft/Imported), sort dropdowns; Pending-first split renders Draft and Live sections separately; card name wrapped in `CardHoverPreview`
- **`secret_lair` Source**: Added to `SOURCE_VALUES`, `WishlistSource`, `SourcePicker`, and `WishlistAcquireDialog`
- **`utils/colors.ts`**: New shared `getColorBucket` utility + `BUCKET_ORDER/LABELS/EMOJI` constants
- **i18n**: 20 new keys in EN + DE (inbox filters, color labels, triage hints, source, duplicates group-by, cardmarket sections)

### Fixed
- `TriageDecisionDialog` price hint now uses `t('triage.sell_price_hint')` instead of hardcoded English string
- Added `CREATE INDEX idx_cards_name_lower ON cards(name COLLATE NOCASE)` for sibling query and listings JOIN performance

## 0.12.0

### Added
- **Inbox & Triage Workflow** (Sprint 12): Triage newly acquired cards detected during Archidekt sync — keep, sell, swap, or dismiss with one click
- **Delta Detection**: Collection sync now snapshots quantities before sync and generates acquisition events for positive deltas (skipped on first sync and full resync)
- **Triage Advisor**: Automated keep-score engine comparing printings by price and foil status — suggests keep/swap/sell with reasoning
- **Acquisition Events API**: 4 REST endpoints — `GET /api/acquisitions/pending` (paginated), `GET /api/acquisitions/stats`, `POST /api/acquisitions/{id}/decide`, `POST /api/acquisitions/{id}/undo`
- **Inbox Page**: Full triage UI with value filter, pagination, source picker (sessionStorage-persistent), skip functionality, and empty state
- **AcquisitionCard Component**: Card detail with existing printings, deck usage, suggestion display, and action buttons

- **Collection CM-Badge**: 🛒 badge on collection entries with active Cardmarket listings (LEFT JOIN on `cardmarket_listings`)
- **Nav Badge**: Pending triage count in navigation with 60s polling + `visibilitychange` refresh
- **2 new MCP Tools**: `get_pending_triage`, `decide_triage`

### Changed
- `sync_collection()` accepts `is_resync` parameter to suppress event generation during full resyncs
- `run_full_resync()` passes `is_resync=True` through to `sync_collection()`
- Collection API enriched with `cardmarket_listing_count` and `cardmarket_listed_qty` per entry

### Technical
- Schema Migration #13: `acquisition_events` table with 13 columns, 2 indexes (`idx_acq_pending`, `idx_acq_card`)
- `backend/app/services/triage_advisor.py` — isolated suggestion engine (no router dependencies)
- `backend/app/routers/acquisitions.py` — triage REST API with cross-field validation
- `frontend/src/pages/Inbox.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/inbox/AcquisitionCard.tsx`, `TriageDecisionDialog.tsx`, `SourcePicker.tsx` — new components
- i18n: 14 new keys per language (EN + DE) for inbox/triage and collection CM-badge

## 0.11.0

### Added
- **Deck Combo Detection** (Sprint 11): Automatic combo discovery via Commander Spellbook integration — combos synced on every deck sync + manual refresh
- **Deck Compare**: Compare 2–4 decks side-by-side — overlap matrix, common cards, unique-per-deck, color identity intersection (`GET /api/decks/compare?ids=…`)
- **Deck Completeness**: Per-deck ownership progress bar with missing card list and estimated cost (`GET /api/decks/{id}/completeness`)
- **Owned-Indicator on Card Search**: Scryfall search results now show `owned_quantity`, `owned_foil_quantity`, and `in_decks` fields (batch query, no N+1)
- **Combo Detail Dialog**: Click any combo to see cards involved, results, prerequisites, steps, and Spellbook link
- **DeckCompare Page**: Full deck comparison UI with multi-select dropdowns, overlap matrix grid, URL-param-based state
- **OwnedBadge Component**: Reusable badge showing "✓ Owned (N×)" with foil indicator and deck tooltip
- **3 new MCP Tools**: `get_deck_combos`, `compare_decks`, `find_card_in_collection`

### Changed
- `sync_deck()` now triggers best-effort combo sync after successful Archidekt import (1s rate-limit between decks)
- Card search endpoints (`/api/cards/search`, `/api/cards/by-name`) enriched with collection ownership data
- Decks page adds "⌬ Compare Decks" navigation button
- DeckView page shows Combos section and Completeness section below AI Assessment

### Fixed
- FastAPI route ordering: `/compare` now correctly defined before `/{deck_id}` to prevent path-parameter matching
- `GET /api/decks/compare` returns HTTP 400 for non-numeric deck IDs (was unhandled ValueError → 500)
- React Fragment key warning in DeckCompare overlap matrix

### Technical
- Schema Migration #12: `deck_combos` table with `deck_id` FK CASCADE, UNIQUE constraint, 2 indexes
- `backend/app/clients/spellbook.py` — Commander Spellbook API client (singleton)
- `backend/app/services/combo_sync.py` — combo fetch/cache service with DELETE-before-INSERT strategy
- `frontend/src/pages/DeckCompare.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/deck/DeckCombosSection.tsx`, `DeckCompletenessSection.tsx`, `ComboDetailDialog.tsx`, `OwnedBadge.tsx` — new components
- i18n: ~20 new keys per language (EN + DE) for combos, compare, completeness, owned indicators

## 0.10.0

### Added
- **Acquisition Tracking** (Sprint 9): Wishlist items now track the full buy-lifecycle via new fields `paid_price_eur`, `expected_price_eur`, `source`, `is_ordered`, `ordered_at`, `not_received_at` (Schema Migration #11)
- **Order Flow**: `POST /api/wishlist/{id}/order` marks an item as ordered with optional expected price; `POST /api/wishlist/{id}/unorder` cancels it. Ordered items show a 📦 badge with expected price in the Active-Tab
- **Acquire Dialog**: "Mark as Received" opens a dialog pre-filled with `expected_price_eur`; user can adjust to actual paid price and select source (`cardmarket | whatnot | booster | trade | gift | shop | other`)
- **Not-Received Flow**: `POST /api/wishlist/{id}/mark-not-received` sets `status=not_received` + timestamp — for lost packages and failed deliveries
- **Acquisition Stats**: `GET /api/wishlist/acquisitions/stats?days=N` returns total acquired count, total spent, current market value, breakdown by source and by month (last 12)
- **Wishlist Tabs**: Four tabs on the Wishlist page — Active (wanted) · History (acquired) · Lost (not_received) · Dropped — each with live item count badge; tab selection persisted to URL (`?tab=…`)
- **History Δ-Column**: Acquired items show paid price vs current market price with color-coded Δ (green = cheaper than market, red = paid more)
- **Listing Health**: `GET /api/cardmarket/listings/health?threshold_pct=15` compares each listing against the latest Cardmarket trend price; returns buckets: `underpriced`, `overpriced`, `fair`, `no_match`. Listings with `price=0` or no trend data go to `no_match`
- **ListingHealthPanel**: New UI panel on the Cardmarket page with threshold slider, bucket filter chips, and suggested-price table
- **5 new MCP Tools**: `mark_wishlist_ordered`, `mark_wishlist_acquired`, `mark_wishlist_not_received`, `get_acquisition_stats`, `analyze_my_listings`

### Changed
- `POST /api/wishlist/{id}/acquire` now accepts optional body `{paid_price_eur, source}`; falls back to `expected_price_eur` when item was previously ordered and no paid price is given
- `GET /api/wishlist/` supports new query params `is_ordered: bool` and convenience alias `status=ordered`
- `WishlistItemRow` actions menu extended with Order / Undo Order / Not Received items (context-sensitive)
- Pydantic `WishlistItemCreate` / `WishlistItemUpdate` status Literal extended with `not_received`
- i18n (EN + DE): `action_order`, `action_unorder`, `action_not_received`, `status_ordered`, `status_not_received`, tab labels

### Fixed
- `POST /api/wishlist/{id}/order` now returns 400 for already-acquired or not-received items (was silently succeeding)
- `POST /api/wishlist/{id}/unorder` now returns 400 "Item is not ordered" if `is_ordered=0` (was missing validation)
- Listing Health: listings with `price=0` no longer misclassified as underpriced — moved to `no_match`

### Technical
- `backend/app/services/listing_health.py` — new service (extracted from cardmarket router)
- `idx_wishlist_status_acquired` partial index on `wishlist(status, acquired_at) WHERE status='acquired'` for stats query performance
- `WishlistAcquireDialog.tsx`, `WishlistOrderDialog.tsx` — new frontend components
- `ListingHealthPanel.tsx` — new cardmarket component with threshold slider

## 0.9.0

### Added
- **Light Theme**: "Daylight Orbital Station" variant — cool near-white (`#F4F5FA`) base, frosted-glass surfaces (`rgba(255,255,255,0.72)`), AA-compliant darker oklch accents for all 6 accent families (sothera / nebula / endstone / stellar / drift / ember)
- **Auto/Dark/Light Toggle**: 3-state theme control in the topbar (◎ AUTO · ◑ DARK · ○ LITE). Auto mode reads `prefers-color-scheme` and updates live on macOS appearance change
- **CSS Custom Property Token System** (`--sv-*`): all design tokens are CSS custom properties that switch atomically under `:root[data-sv-theme="light"]` — zero page-level code changes required
- **`SotheraThemeProvider`** + **`useSotheraTheme()`** hook (`src/theme/index.ts`): returns `{mode, setMode, isDark, fluentTheme}`. Theme choice persisted to `localStorage` under key `sothera.theme`
- **`ACCENTS_LIGHT`**: Light-mode accent map (darkened for AA contrast on white surfaces) exposed alongside `ACCENTS` (dark)

### Changed
- **BackdropFX**: Light branch — nebula masked to upper 35% of viewport (no full-bleed), no star dust, softer glow. Dark branch unchanged
- **Sparkline galaxy-foil**: Fill gradient stops use `var(--sv-foil-sN)` + `var(--sv-foil-top-opacity)` — switches automatically between dark (high-chroma) and light (−30% chroma) variants
- **Topbar accent picker**: Swatches reflect the active theme's accent variant (dark vs light)
- **`FluentProvider`**: Now picks `sotheraTheme` (dark) or `sotheraLightTheme` (light, built with `createLightTheme`) at runtime — no static import
- **220ms crossfade**: `transition: background-color 220ms, color 220ms, border-color 220ms` applied globally via `index.css` — no hard cutover flash on theme switch
- **Scrollbar**: Uses `var(--sv-border-strong)` / `var(--sv-fg-faint)` — inverts cleanly on light
- **Bundle size**: 1,010 KB → 1,024 KB (+14 KB raw / ~4 KB gzip) — delta from `createLightTheme` import

### Technical
- No `isDark` ternaries in any page or component — token layer is the single source of truth
- `tsc --noEmit`: 0 errors; `npm run build`: clean
- No new runtime dependencies

## 0.8.0

### Added
- **Sothera Vault Redesign**: Complete frontend redesign with space-opera aesthetic
- **Theme System**: `src/theme/sothera.ts` — oklch accent ramp (6 named accents: sothera/nebula/endstone/stellar/drift/ember), glass surface tokens, dark Fluent UI theme override
- **Shared Primitives**: `src/components/sothera/` — Panel, PageHeader, SectionHeader, DeltaBadge, CornerTicks, Sigil, BackdropFX
- **Accent Picker**: Swappable accent colors persisted to localStorage, accessible from the topbar
- **Galaxy-Foil Sparkline**: Rewritten Sparkline component with gradient fill, grid pattern, and glowing accent dot with concentric rings
- **BackdropFX**: Animated starfield + nebula glow + horizon haze background layer

### Changed
- **Typography**: Space Grotesk (display, 600-700), Inter (body, 400-500), JetBrains Mono (mono/data, 500-600) via Google Fonts CDN
- **All 8 pages rewritten**: Dashboard, Decks, DeckView, Collection, Cardmarket, Duplicates, Wishlist, Settings — from Fluent UI defaults to Sothera glass-panel layout with custom CSS grid tables

- **Background**: #04040A base with layered radial nebula gradients, replacing default Fluent dark/light mode

- **Bundle size**: Reduced by ~42 KB (1,052 KB → 1,010 KB) by dropping unused Fluent UI Table/Card imports

3. Delete the local add-on folder: `rm -rf /addons/mtg-collection`
4. Add the repository URL in HA and reinstall the add-on
5. Restore the DB: `cp /backup/mtg.db.YYYYMMDD /data/mtg.db`
